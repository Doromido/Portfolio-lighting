      content="This project was created as part of my portfolio. It features a landing page focused on modern UI design and user interaction. The main highlight is the light/dark theme switch — the lamp on the page reacts to the theme change by turning on or off accordingly. The page also includes interactive elements such as an animated menu and buttons."
